This Summer, I decided to make a career change. 

I'd spent the last ~5 years working in Product Management, and while I enjoyed many aspects of my professional life - it had become apparent that I needed a change.

I wanted to spend more of my time and energy creating. As a PM I did the (necessary! challenging! often frustrating!) work of creating optimal conditions for good software to be created by others. 

So, I decided to take a career break to learn to build software. I figured, even if I returned to Product roles, I'd have upskilled & enabled myself to build side projects.

Despite feeling fashionably late to the party, I decided to do a bootcamp. Here are some of the projects I worked on during that time.

### 2cents, pay for what you wiki

Despite fully believing that it is a force for good and a beautiful, humanist holdover from a more optimistic time on the internet, I have never donated to Wikipedia. 

Instead of trying to understand why that is, I closed the gap between intention and action with sweet, sweet technology.

2cents is a chrome extension that automatically donates an amount of your choosing to Wikipedia for each distinct wiki article you read every week.

* Built with js, stripe
* Uses google oauth based on the chrome browser profile
* <a href="https://github.com/JordanSucher/2cents">Github repo</a>
