title: Gistified, a podcast condenser
---

My podcast eyes are bigger than my ear stomach.

I subscribe to 133 of them. If even half released a weekly 30 minute episode, I'd need to clock more than a full day of listening to catch up!

<a href="http://gistified.vercel.app/">Gistified</a> turns your podcast subscriptions into an inbox of summaries, distilling lengthy episodes into takeaways and key quotes. 

Part of me finds this project a little distasteful, taking a carefully labored over piece of media and boiling it down into an infotritional supplement. But, as with meal replacements, something is better than nothing - and I'll take podcast soylent over skipping info dinner any day.

This tool has had a surprisingly large impact on my media consumption. There were so many little pockets of intrigue that I had simply trained myself to ignore because I didn't have enough time or brainspace for them. 

But in the past few weeks I've learned things about housing policy, geopolitics, and active supreme court cases that I otherwise would never have had time to know!
